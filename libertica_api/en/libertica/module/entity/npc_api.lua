--- #### Example:
--- Creates a simple NPC.
--- ```lua
--- MyNpc = NpcCompose {
---     ScriptName = "HansWurst",
---     Callback   = function(_Data)
---         local HeroID = CONST_LAST_HERO_INTERACTED;
---         local NpcID = GetID(_Data.ScriptName);
---     end
--- }
--- ```
---
--- #### Example:
--- Creates a NPC with conditions.
--- ```lua
--- MyNpc = NpcCompose {
---     ScriptName = "HansWurst",
---     Condition  = function(_Data)
---         local NpcID = GetID(_Data.ScriptName);
---         -- pr√ºfe irgend was
---         return MyConditon == true;
---     end
---     Callback  = function(_Data)
---         local HeroID = CONST_LAST_HERO_INTERACTED;
---         local NpcID = GetID(_Data.ScriptName);
---     end
--- }
---```
---
--- #### Example:
--- Limit players for activation.
--- ```lua
--- MyNpc = NpcCompose {
---     ScriptName        = "HansWurst",
---     Player            = {1, 2},
---     WrongPlayerAction = function(_Data)
---         AddNote("I will not talk to you!");
---     end,
---     Callback          = function(_Data)
---         local HeroID = CONST_LAST_HERO_INTERACTED;
---         local NpcID = GetID(_Data.ScriptName);
---     end
--- }
---```
---
--- @param _Data table NPC data
--- @return table NPC NPC data
function NpcCompose(_Data)
    return {};
end
API.NpcCompose = NpcCompose;

--- Removes the NPC but does not delete the entity.
--- @param _Data table NPC data
function NpcDispose(_Data)
end
API.NpcDispose = NpcDispose;

--- Updates the NPC with the data table.

--- ```
---
--- @param _Data table NPC data
function NpcUpdate(_Data)
end
API.NpcUpdate = NpcUpdate;
