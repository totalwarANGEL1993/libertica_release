Lib.Sound = Lib.Sound or {};



--- Starts an event playlist.
---
--- It is possible to import custom files into the game by saving them into
--- the map archive. A playlist needs a XML file defining it and the files
--- with the music.
---
--- To avoid problems with music files it is best practice to give all files
--- a unique name. For example find a short prefix for all files taken from
--- the map name. If multiple maps with the same files inside the playlist or
--- music directory are present then files will be overwritten!
---
--- #### File structure for custom playlists:
--- ```xml
--- map_xyz.s6xmap.unpacked
--- |-- music/*
--- |-- config/sound/*
--- |-- maps/externalmap/map_xyz/*
--- |-- ...
--- ```
---
--- #### Example structure of playlist:
--- ```xml
--- <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
--- <PlayList>
---  <PlayListEntry>
---    <FileName>Music\some_music_file.mp3</FileName>
---    <Type>Loop</Type>
---  </PlayListEntry>
---  <!-- Add entries here -->
--- </PlayList>
--- ```
---
--- Playlist entries can be looped by using `Loop` as type or be played once
--- with `Normal` as type.
---
--- Also a propability can be used. This indicates the probability of a track
--- being played.
--- 
--- ```xml
--- <Chance>10</Chance>
--- ```
